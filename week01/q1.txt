# To create the git repository, I first created a repository called proj,
# short for project. In the proj repository, I typed "git init" and created
# a sub-direcotry called "week01", then "git add week01" and "git add 
# README.md". Typed in git commit -m "first commit". At last, use "git remote
# add origin https://github.com/chonichen/test.git", which will ask for my 
# github account username and password, then use "git push -u origin master"
# to push the changes in the file.
